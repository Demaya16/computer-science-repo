# Cybersecurity FireWall Network Topology 

## Author Information
- **Name:** Devin Maya


## Project Overview
This lab focuses on fundamental cybersecurity concepts, network topology creation, and basic shell scripting. It demonstrates the practical application of network security principles using Mininet, a network emulator, to create and manipulate virtual network environments.

## Submission Contents

### 1. DevinMaya-lab1.pdf
- Comprehensive solutions to Prelab and Lab questions
- Detailed explanations of cybersecurity concepts explored
- Screenshots demonstrating:
  - Network topology configurations
  - Command outputs
  - Security testing results

### 2. DevinMaya-script.sh
- A shell script created during Prelab 1
- Demonstrates basic system information gathering and security checks
- **Important:** Ensure executable permissions are set before running

  ```bash
  chmod +x DevinMaya-script.sh
  ```

- To run the script:

  ```bash
  ./DevinMaya-script.sh
  ```

### 3. DevinMaya-topo.py
- Python script defining a custom Mininet topology for Lab 1
- Implements a network configuration with:
  - Multiple hosts
  - Switches
  - Interconnections
- Simulates a real-world network for cybersecurity testing

### 4. README.md
- This file, providing an overview of the project and submission details

## Lab Objectives and Cybersecurity Focus

1. **Network Topology Design:**
   - Create and manipulate virtual network environments
   - Understand the implications of different network structures on security

2. **Basic Security Scripting:**
   - Develop shell scripts for system information gathering
   - Implement simple security checks and reporting

3. **Mininet Exploration:**
   - Use Mininet to simulate complex network topologies
   - Analyze network behavior in a controlled environment

4. **Security Testing:**
   - Perform basic security tests on the created network topology
   - Understand potential vulnerabilities in different network configurations

5. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Practice clear and concise documentation of security-related tasks
   - Learn to effectively communicate network configurations and test results

## Setup and Execution Instructions

### Shell Script (DevinMaya-script.sh)
1. Set executable permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x DevinMaya-script.sh
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./DevinMaya-script.sh
   ```

### Topology Script (DevinMaya-topo.py)
1. Ensure Python and Mininet are installed on your system
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   sudo python DevinMaya-topo.py
   ```

## Additional Notes
- The lab exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with network security concepts
- Pay special attention to the security implications of different network configurations
- The scripts and topologies created serve as a foundation for more advanced cybersecurity experiments
